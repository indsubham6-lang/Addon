 * MODIFICATION HISTORY
 * ============================================================
 * 2025-06-14   Subham Mahesh   First modification

 * Note: Due to inline constraints, subsequent modifications may
 * not appear here. To view the full history, run:
 *
 *   node linkumori-cli-tool.js
 *
 * Select "Generate Commit History" to produce a Markdown file
 * listing all modifications by file, author, and date.
 *
 * IMPORTANT NOTES
 * ---------------
 * - git clone is required before running "Generate Commit History";
 *   otherwise commit history generation will not work.
 * - Older modifications may not appear in the generated
 *   COMMIT_HISTORY.md.
 * - If a file's inline notice is limited, check for a separate
 *   file-specific notice and COMMIT_HISTORY.md; if neither exists,
 *   treat the inline notice as the final modification record.
 * - If a separate file-specific notice is provided, check the
 *   file's inline notice and COMMIT_HISTORY.md; if neither exists,
 *   treat the separate notice as the final modification record.
 * - Review individual modified source files for earlier notices.
 * - Some files may not contain notices within the file itself or
 *   may not be listed in COMMIT_HISTORY.md; a separate notice
 *   file may be provided instead.
 * - Not all source files have been modified, but review notices
 *   in all source files and any separate notice files (.md or .txt).
